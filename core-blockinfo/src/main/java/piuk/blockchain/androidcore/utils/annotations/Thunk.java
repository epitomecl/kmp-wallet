/**
 * Indicates that the given field or method has package visibility solely to prevent the creation of
 * a synthetic method. In practice, you should treat this field/method as if it were private.
 *
 * When a private method is called from an inner class, the Java compiler generates a simple package
 * private shim method that the class generated from the inner class can call. This results in
 * unnecessary bloat and runtime method call overhead. It also gets us closer to the dex method
 * count limit.
 *
 * If you'd like to see warnings for these synthetic methods in Android Studio: Preferences > Editor
 * > Inspections > J2ME Issues > "Private member access between outer and inner classes". This is
 * disabled by default.
